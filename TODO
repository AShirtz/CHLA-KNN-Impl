This file contains all of the things I left for later...

	Of course, the big one is that all of this code
	is meant for 3D. Ideally, dimension should be compile
	or run time determined. This is a windmill for another day.


	Eh, I guess I should put "Finish this document" in here, 
	but that feels bad. I've been working with recursive methods
	perhaps a bit too much...

	(10/3) Where I left off was: 9tc.c & Queries.c 
	I was process of implementing/experimenting the kNN
	query.
