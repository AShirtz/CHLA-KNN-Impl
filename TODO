This file contains all of the things I left for later...

	Of course, the big one is that all of this code
	is meant for 3D. Ideally, dimension should be compile
	or run time determined. This is a windmill for another day.


	Eh, I guess I should put "Finish this document" in here, 
	but that feels bad. I've been working with recursive methods
	perhaps a bit too much...

	(10/3) Where I left off was: 9tc.c & Queries.c 
	I was process of implementing/experimenting the kNN
	query. 


(10/3)
	Came back to it today, doing some amount of prep for the kNN impl,
	Ran some of the tests, as I added a cleanupLatAddr function, and found some
	tests that were SegFaulting. Probably not an issue, just file names or
	something, but I should look into it and make it so that it doesn't do that.
	Cosmetic reasons yeah? 
		After some digging, I found that it is because 6tc.c doesn't use
		the data members built into DataPointEntry, so writing/reading
		doesn't work with the new version of the object...

	So I'm going to bed again, odd how I have to continue doing that.
	Anywho, I'm about half done with the kNN impl, but it's not in the Queries.c
	file, as I spent all of tonight chasing ghosts and getting a context. See
	the src/test/10tc.c file to see how to do the first half of the kNN callback.
	I have the bounding volume and common prefix length finding. I should do 
	a little bit of tree behavior cleanup next.

	Specifically, I currently have the two functions nodeInsert and nodeTraverse,
	which travel along a CanAddr and flood under the given node. These two behaviors
	have more uses than is currently allowed so they should be refactored into a
	more general form. As an example, nodeInsert becomes nodeTraverse and nodeTraverse
	becomes nodeFlood. The new function nodeTraverse hase callbacks for the following
	tree navigation events; intermediate node hit, leaf node hit, depth expended, etc.
	What I am going for here, is a general use function for tree navigation...
